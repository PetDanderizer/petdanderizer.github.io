            <h1>Welcome to Celeste</h1>
            <p>My favorite game, with insane(ly good) platforming, a massive speedrun and modding / custom level community, and absolutely beautiful art and music.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h2>Steam description</h2>
            <p> Help Madeline survive her inner demons on her journey to the top of Celeste Mountain, in this super-tight, hand-crafted platformer from the creators of multiplayer classic TowerFall.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A narrative-driven, single-player adventure like mom used to make, with a charming cast of characters and a touching story of self-discovery</li>
                <li>A massive mountain teeming with 700+ screens of hardcore platforming challenges and devious secrets</li>
                <li>Brutal B-side chapters to unlock, built for only the bravest mountaineers</li>
                <li>IGF “Excellence in Audio” finalist, with over 2 hours of original music led by dazzling live piano and catchy synth beats</li>
                <li>Pie</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The controls are simple and accessible - simply jump, air-dash, and climb - but with layers of expressive depth to master, where every death is a lesson. Lightning-fast respawns keep you climbing as you uncover the mysteries of the mountain and brave its many perils.</p>
            <p><i>This is it, Madeline. Just breathe. You can do this.</i></p>
